## **Why we built data.all**

Data teams can be diverse: analysts, scientists, engineers, business users. Diverse people, with 
diverse tools and skillsets — diverse "DNAs". All leading to chaos and resulting in titanic 
efforts spent in Collaboration Overhead.

Using data.all, any line of business within an organization can create their own isolated data lake, 
produce, consume and share data within and across business units, worldwide. By simplifying data discovery, 
data access management while letting more builders use AWS vast portfolio of data and analytics services, 
data.all helps more data teams discover relevant data and let them use the power of the AWS cloud 
to create data driven applications faster.
